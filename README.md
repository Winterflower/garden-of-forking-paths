# Garden of Forking Paths 
What if every new step involves a new possible route, a garden of forking paths, a maze of cool things to be discovered.
Inspired by Jorge Louis Borges' short story of the same name.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore real-or-near real time algorithms for pathfinding on maps and in constrained environments.
